# Python Pro

Modern Python development with a focus on correctness, performance, and maintainability.

## Use this skill when

- Building Python services, CLIs, or libraries
- Designing async workflows
- Setting up Python tooling and testing

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is primarily about another runtime

## Workflow (Deterministic)

1. Confirm runtime and packaging (pyproject, uv/pip).
2. Choose async vs sync patterns.
3. Implement with typing and validation at boundaries.
4. Add tests and linting.

## Output Contract (Always)

- Code changes with clear module boundaries
- Testing and verification steps
- Tooling notes (ruff/pytest)

## References (Optional)

- Modern Python: `references/modern-python.md`
- FastAPI: `references/fastapi.md`
- Django: `references/django.md`
- Tooling: `references/tooling.md`
- Testing: `references/testing.md`
