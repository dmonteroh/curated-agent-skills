# Identity, Authorization, and AppSec

## Modern Authentication & Authorization

- Identity protocols: OAuth 2.0/2.1, OpenID Connect, SAML 2.0, WebAuthn, FIDO2.
- JWT security: key rotation, audience/issuer validation, token lifetime controls.
- Zero-trust architecture: continuous verification and identity-based access.
- Multi-factor authentication: TOTP, hardware tokens, biometric options.
- Authorization patterns: RBAC, ABAC, ReBAC, policy engines.
- API security: scoped access, rate limiting, and threat protection.

## OWASP & Vulnerability Management

- OWASP Top 10 risks and common failure modes.
- OWASP ASVS for requirement mapping and verification.
- OWASP SAMM for maturity assessment.
- Threat modeling approaches: STRIDE, PASTA, attack trees.
- Risk assessment: CVSS scoring and business impact analysis.

## Secure Coding & Development

- Secure coding standards and vetted libraries.
- Input validation with parameterized queries and output encoding.
- Encryption configuration for data in transit and at rest.
- Security headers: CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, SameSite cookies.
- API security: REST/GraphQL error handling and schema validation.
- Database security: injection prevention and access controls.
- See `references/backend-security-coding.md` for a condensed checklist.
