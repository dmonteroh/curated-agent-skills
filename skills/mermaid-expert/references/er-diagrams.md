# ER Diagrams (erDiagram)

## Tips

- Use clear relationship cardinalities (`||--o{`, `||--||`, etc.).
- Mark keys consistently (PK/FK/UK).
- Keep types approximate; the goal is understanding, not DDL generation.

## When Not To Use ERDs

- When the story is about behavior and workflows (use sequence/flow).
- When the model is extremely large (split by bounded context).
