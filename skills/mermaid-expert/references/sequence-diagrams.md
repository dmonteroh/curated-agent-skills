# Sequence Diagrams

## Tips

- Use `autonumber` for long flows.
- Use `alt`/`else` for branches and `opt` for optional behavior.
- Keep participants stable across diagrams for consistent reading.

## Good Practices

- Show boundaries (client vs API vs DB vs external dependencies).
- Include failure paths (timeouts, retries, idempotency).
- If a call is asynchronous, label it explicitly.
