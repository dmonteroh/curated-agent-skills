- `execution-queued-serial.md`: multiple tasks, executed one worker session at a time.
- `execution-true-parallel.md`: isolated concurrent workers with disjoint claims and worktree planning.
- `execution-prompt-parallel.md`: parallel planning with sequential execution.
- `runtime-codex.md`: Codex-specific dispatch pattern (`codex exec`).
- `runtime-claude.md`: Claude model/effort policy, dispatch packet, mode notes, and permission recovery.
