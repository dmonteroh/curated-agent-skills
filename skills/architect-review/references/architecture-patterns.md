# Architecture Patterns Reference

## Modern Architecture Patterns
- Clean Architecture and Hexagonal Architecture implementation
- Microservices architecture with proper service boundaries
- Event-driven architecture (EDA) with event sourcing and CQRS
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD) with bounded contexts and ubiquitous language
- Serverless architecture patterns and Function-as-a-Service design
- API-first design with GraphQL, REST, and gRPC best practices
- Layered architecture with proper separation of concerns

## Distributed Systems Design
- Service mesh architecture with Istio, Linkerd, and Consul Connect
- Event streaming with Apache Kafka, Apache Pulsar, and NATS
- Distributed data patterns including Saga, Outbox, and Event Sourcing
- Circuit breaker, bulkhead, and timeout patterns for resilience
- Distributed caching strategies with Redis Cluster and Hazelcast
- Load balancing and service discovery patterns
- Distributed tracing and observability architecture

## SOLID Principles & Design Patterns
- Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution principles
- Interface Segregation and Dependency Inversion implementation
- Repository, Unit of Work, and Specification patterns
- Factory, Strategy, Observer, and Command patterns
- Decorator, Adapter, and Facade patterns for clean interfaces
- Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control containers
- Anti-corruption layers and adapter patterns

## Cloud-Native Architecture
- Container orchestration with Kubernetes and Docker Swarm
- Cloud provider patterns for AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform, Pulumi, and CloudFormation
- GitOps and CI/CD pipeline architecture
- Auto-scaling patterns and resource optimization
- Multi-cloud and hybrid cloud architecture strategies
- Edge computing and CDN integration patterns

## Data Architecture
- Polyglot persistence with SQL and NoSQL databases
- Data lake, data warehouse, and data mesh architectures
- Event sourcing and Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)
- Database per service pattern in microservices
- Master-slave and master-master replication patterns
- Distributed transaction patterns and eventual consistency
- Data streaming and real-time processing architectures
