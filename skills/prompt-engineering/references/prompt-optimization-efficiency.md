# Prompt Optimization for Efficiency

## Token reduction tactics

- Remove redundant phrases and filler words.
- Consolidate instructions into short bullet lists.
- Use reusable labels (e.g., "Output Format" section).

## Latency reduction tactics

- Minimize prompt length before adding constraints.
- Avoid unnecessary examples when the task is stable.
- Set explicit output length limits when appropriate.

## Cost control checklist

- Track tokens per request and per response.
- Prefer short, high-signal examples.
- Avoid large chains of tool calls unless required.
