# Tailwind Design System (Condensed)

## Token Hierarchy

- Brand tokens -> Semantic tokens -> Component tokens.

## Component Architecture

- Base -> Variants -> Sizes -> States -> Overrides.

## Notes

- CSS variables support theming.
- Semantic names (`primary`, `surface`) are preferred over raw colors.
- Keep tokens centralized in `tailwind.config.*` and global CSS.
