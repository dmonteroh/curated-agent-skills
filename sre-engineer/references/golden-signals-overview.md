# Golden Signals Overview

The four golden signals every service should measure:

- **Latency**: p50/p95/p99 request duration for success and failure.
- **Traffic**: requests per second or events per second.
- **Errors**: error rate or failed transactions per total.
- **Saturation**: resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk, queue depth).

Use this list to sanity-check SLI coverage and alerting scope.
