# UI Design Workflows (Condensed)

- Design system setup: define tokens, spacing, typography, and component patterns.
- Component creation: clarify purpose, states, props, and usage before code.
- Design review: assess layout, hierarchy, interaction, and accessibility basics.
- Accessibility audit: check contrast, focus, keyboard paths, ARIA.
