# React + Next Frontend

React/Next.js-focused frontend skill for implementation work: components, state/data fetching, accessibility, and performance.

## Use this skill when

- Building or refactoring React components.
- Working in a Next.js app (routing, server/client boundaries, data fetching).
- Fixing frontend bugs, performance regressions, or accessibility issues in React/Next.

## Do not use this skill when

- The project is Angular or SvelteKit (use a stack-specific skill instead).
- The request is backend-only.

## Instructions

- Clarify target UX and constraints (responsive, accessibility, perf budget).
- Keep components small; prefer composable primitives.
- Ensure keyboard navigation and ARIA correctness.
- Validate data fetching and caching strategy (avoid waterfalls).
- Add tests where appropriate (unit + integration + e2e as needed).
